            <p><strong>Data Types in JS - </strong>JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language,
                which means we don't need to define data type of a variable while declaring it.
                data type is assigned depending on value at run time. 

            </p>
            <p>However, javascript has many data types which can be categorised mainly in 
                two category - 1. Primitive Data Type 2. Non Primitive(Object) Data Type
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Primitive Data Type - </strong>
            This is pass by value. Means if we assing one variable to other, it will copy 
        the same value. For example - <br/>
            <pre>
                let a = 26, 
                let b;
                b=a;
                console.log(b) // output will be 26
            </pre>   
        </p>
        <p>Number, String, undefined, null, Boolean and Symbol are primitive data types. 
            Symbol is introduced in ES6, symbols are unique and immutable data types.
        </p>
        </li>

        <LI>
            <P><STRONG>Non-Primitive(Object) Data Type - </STRONG>Non-primitive are pass
            by reference. Means variables are stored in the main memory while values 
        are stored in the heap memory. Both variable and values are connected to pointer.
           So if we assing one variable to other, it only assign the pointer, don't copy
        the value</P>
        <p>Object, Array and functions are non-primitive data type</p>
        </LI>
