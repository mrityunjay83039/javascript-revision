    <h1>Debouncing and Throttling</h1>
    <p>
      It is used for performance optimization. it can be used where we have
      frequent events like resizing, input events or scrolling.
      <br />
      It is used to control the rate at which a particular function is executed.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Debouncing - </strong>
            In Debouncing we set a particular time, if no event is
            triggered within the time, function will be called.
            <br />
            So what it does is, it will not contineously call the function if
            event is triggering frequently. It will call the fun only if event
            is not triggered till the time set.
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Throttling - </strong>
          In Throttling, instead of waiting for a particular time to call the
          function, we call function on a specific interval if contineous even
          triggering is happening.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      => Use debouncing when you want to delay the execution of a function until a
      pause in events occurs. <br>
      => Use throttling when you want to limit the rate at
      which a function is executed, ensuring it doesn't happen more frequently
      than a specified interval.
