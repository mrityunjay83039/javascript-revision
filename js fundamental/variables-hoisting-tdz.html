    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Variable - </strong>In JavaScript variables can be declared using
                var, let and const. var is not the recommended way. it should be rarely used.
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Difference Between Var, Let, Const - </strong>
            <p><strong>Var</strong> - var has functional scope. Means it can be
                accessed anywhere in the function it is defined. It can be re declared
                and re assigned also.
                If we declare a variable with var in global scope, mean not side in any function
                it will work as global variable. <br>
                The reason why it is not recommended is that, it can be re-declared and that can
                be a problem if multiple developers working on the same project. <br>
                ariables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase, which
                means you can use a variable before it's declared in the code.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Let - </strong>Let has block scope(enclosed by curly braces) . It is introduced in ES6.
                We can not re-declare it but can re-assign. variables are hoisted to the top of their block but are not
                initialized until the actual declaration is encountered during runtime.</p>

            <p><strong>Const - </strong>Similar to let, const has block level scope.
                it is used for variables that should not be reassigned after initialization.
                 However, it does not make the variable itself immutable; it just prevents
                  reassignment. variables are hoisted to the top of their block but are not initialized untill the
                  actual declaration is encountered during run time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Temporal Dead Zone - </strong>The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript refers to the period between the start of the scope and the point where a variable is declared. During this period, attempting to access the variable will result in a ReferenceError. This concept is associated with variables declared using let and const declarations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Hoisting - </strong>Whenever a code runs in javascript, it creates a global execution context
            It has two phases, 1st Memory Allocation phase and the second is code execution phase.
            <p>In memor excution phase, first all variables and functions are stored in main memory with key:value
                pair. while storing the variables in main memory, first all variables are assigned a value 'undefined'. 
                functions are stored with complete body. 
            </p>
            <p>So if we try to access a variable before its initialization, it will return undefined. It works 
                same way for let and const also but because of the TDZ, it throw a reference error.
            </p>

        // lets try to access var a outside of the function test.
        // console.log(a);    // ReferenceError: a is not defined

        function test(){
            // try to see if var a is hoisted 
            console.log(a);       // Output : undefined

            var a = 9;
            // try to access let and const outside of block. Here b and c are consoled outside the block scope.
            // console.log(b);         // ReferenceError: b is not defined
            // console.log(c);         // ReferenceError: c is not defined

            if(a){

                // console.log(b); // console b before declaration. Output: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization

                let b = 10;
                const c = 2;
                // try to re-declare b and c 
                // let b = 30;   // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
                // const c = 4;     // SyntaxError: Identifier 'c' has already been declared

                // lets try to re-assign both b and c
                b = 50;
                // c = 100;           //TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

                console.log(b)        // Output: 50
